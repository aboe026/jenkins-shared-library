Jenkins CI shared library files

## Lint

Linting code for programmatic and stylistic error detection is handled through [npm-groovy-lint](https://github.com/nvuillam/npm-groovy-lint).

If you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed, you can run

```sh
npx npm-groovy-lint
```

To keep this repo as light as possible there is no node module configured to run `npm-groovy-lint` through NodeJS, instead linting can be run locally through docker:

```sh

```
